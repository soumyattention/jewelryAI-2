## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL NEXT STEP (Do This Weekend)

### Bing Webmaster Tools Setup (15 minutes)

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://www.bing.com/webmasters
2. Add site: https://jewelryai.app
3. Verify ownership (HTML tag method easiest)
4. Submit 3 sitemaps:
   - https://jewelryai.app/sitemap.xml
   - https://jewelryai.app/sitemap-images.xml
   - https://jewelryai.app/sitemap-videos.xml

**Result:** ChatGPT can find and cite you within 7-14 days
